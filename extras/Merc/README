INTRODUCTION

This software package contains a snapshot of Colyseus and Mercury, an
architecture for distributed multiplayer games and a range-based DHT,
respectively. See the URL above for more information.


INSTALLATION

This software currently only compiles and runs on Linux x86. You must
use gcc 3.2-3.4 (we have only extensively tested gcc 3.2.2). In addition,
you need GNU make and perl >= 5.8.0.

(1) First, you must install the following development libraries and headers:

    * glibc >= 2.3.2 (with pthreads)
    * libgmp >= 4.1.2
    * zlib >= 1.1.4
    * XFree86 >= 4.2.0 or xorg equivalent (for the vizualizer)
    * SDL >= 1.2.4 (for the vizualizer)
    * SDL_image >= 1.2.2 (for the visualizer)

(2) Place Merc/ in your home directory.

(3) To compile the software, enter the Merc/ directory and type 'make'.
    If something fails, it is possible that we missed a dependency in
    the list above. Please let us know.

(4) Enter Merc/run/ and untar lib-5.8.0-i686-linux.tar.gz which will
    create Merc/run/lib/.
