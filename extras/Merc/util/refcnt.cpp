 * XXX - workaround for egregious egcs bug.
 *
 * On OpenBSD, egcs does not support inline functions with static
 * variables properly.  For example, what we want is:
 *    class __globaldestruction_t {
 *      bool &started () { static bool val; return val; }
 *    public:
 *      ~__globaldestruction_t () { started () = true; }
 *      operator bool () { return started () }
 *    };
 * But that doesn't work, so we need a whole file just for one bit!
